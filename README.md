## Project description

Seniors' Dating App aimed to produce an online-dating application for senior citizens aged 65+. It pairs users based on mutual interests, as well as their locations. There are features that enable group chats and building a personal profile, as well as usability features that improve the experience for the end-user. 

## Building tools

This project was built using Java and Android Studio.

## What I learnt

This is the first project I built that carefully examined UX and UI, so I spent more time considering these aspects of the process. I used an Agile method of developing the project as the needs of it were changing frequently, so I became more accustomed to the development lifecycle of software. I furthered my programming knowledge too, as this is the first project I built in Java for a while so it was good to get a refresher on some OOP concepts.
